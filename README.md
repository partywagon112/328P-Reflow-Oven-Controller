# Known Issues and workarounds because there ait going to be another one of these things for a while
- Possible issue with backfeed via USB, cut trace to USB if required. Not generally necessary. 
- USB works C->A, but not C->C. Definite compliance issue.
- Very poor grounding between four corners. Fixed by using a conductive PLA or conductive tape within enclosure.
